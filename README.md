# Leaf-Image-Classifier
Plant Species Classification using leaf images with CNN
# Description:
The objective is to use leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin & texture, to accurately identify the species. The goal is to build a model/classifier that uses the pre-extracted features and train neural network for classification of leaf images to identify the species. Finally, examine the errors and improve the accuracy.
# Dependencies:
System Requirements:
You need to have following software on your computer to run the project file.
1. Python 3.0 and above
2. TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy packages
